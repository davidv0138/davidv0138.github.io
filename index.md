## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
Lab 1 Part 1
In this lab, I worked well with my partner and overall had a nice dynamic working together. What I really enjoyed about the lab was just getting back into coding from my previous experiences and using them in the lab which made the overall lab experience a breeze but fun to revisit concepts that I have learned and finally put them into use. This Lab introduced pivotal code ideas and concepts that besides being basic, helped us throughout the semester and showed us how far we had had come from the code used in Lab 1.

Lab 8 part 1
I thought this lab was challenging but rewarding and easy to understand with trial and error. Me and my partner had worked together before, and we had really great chemistry that made the Lab enjoyable and insightful as we both shared ideas and solved the problems that came our way. This Lab had a main focus on an algorithm that calculates the average of scores from the Olympics. Understanding vectors and their code structure came to be a hard concept for both us to understand but we slowly understood through notes and carefully understanding the structure of the problems. 

Lab 11 part 1
This was by far the most fun lab I've had as it was challenging but my group breezed through it even though we were stumped and were cautious about our code. Me and my partner both worked really well together taking turns and going over ways on what was the best approach to the Todos given to us. This was another algorithm with a focus on vector statements that looked for the highest and lowest density of a state.
